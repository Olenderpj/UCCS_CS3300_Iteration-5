# Instructions:

---

1. Generate the views associated with devise by running the following command (This will be useful for iteration 06). <br>
   `rails generate devise:views users`


2. You will be modifying the following 3 views to look like the wireframe diagrams that you created in iteration 02 earlier in the semester. <br>
   ```diff
   + Remember to push your code changes to GitHub early and often so that you avoid losing completed work.
   ```
      1. Project "Show" View <br>
         - \<PORTFOLIO PROJECT\>/app/views/projects/**show.html.erb** <br> 
      2. Project "New" View <br>
         - \<PORTFOLIO PROJECT\>/app/views/projects/**new.html.erb** <br>
      3. Project "Edit" View <br>
         - \<PORTFOLIO PROJECT\>/app/views/projects/**edit.html.erb** <br>
      

3. Take a screenshot of each initial view to show your starting point.


4. Modify the HTML and CSS code for each of the views and push your code to GitHub when complete.<br>


5. Take a second screenshot of your finalized views to show your progress.
